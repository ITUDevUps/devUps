\section{Conclusion}
The group has during the course taken a legacy MiniTwit python application and have developed it to a new tech stack using DevOps praticies and DevOps techniques such as logging, monitoring and automatic CI/CD \\

Throughout the project, the advantages of adopting DevOps principles and implementing artifacts became increasingly apparent. Not only were mistakes detected and resolved more efficiently during development, but deployments and quality control processes were also automated, accelerated, and more reliable. \\

The project served as an invaluable learning platform, allowing the team to apply DevOps techniques rather than simply studying them theoretically. This hands-on experience also exposed them to the challenges and complexities of configuring a system of this size. By providing a safe environment for DevOps, the project encouraged experimentation with various tools and technologies, even those unfamiliar to the team members. \\

As a result, the developers acquired firsthand insights into the benefits of DevOps, which they will carry forward into their future hobby projects and professional software careers. With this knowledge, they are better equipped to drive efficiency, collaboration, and robustness in their future developments. The project not only exemplified the power of DevOps but also empowered the team to embrace DevOps in their ongoing software development journey.
