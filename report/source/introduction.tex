\section{Introduction}
This paper describes the work done for migrating, maintaining and further developing the web application ITU-MiniTwit, a "micro blogging platform".
The primary goals of this project were to gain practical experience with \textit{DevOps} principles while refactoring the legacy code of ITU-MiniTwit to a new codebase. The refactoring involved understanding and evaluating the legacy code, deciding on a new relevant technology stack and further enhancing it while using various DevOps practices.

DevOps covers a range of topics related to scalability, maintainability and ensuring code quality among others. They are all rooted in software evolution and maintenance. During the project several challenges were encountered that required further learning and adapting to new technologies
