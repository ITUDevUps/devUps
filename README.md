# MiniTwit

MiniTwit is a dashboard/blogging platform where users can make posts. Originally made in Python with Flask, it is currently in 
the process of being reworked to a C#/React web-application. This project is part of the course DevOps at IT-Univeristy of Copenhagen, 2023. 





## Installation on Windows/Linux/macOS

You need Docker installed for this project. To install this look at [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
After ensuring Docker is installed clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TikoyX/devUps.git
```
From the directory, then run the follwing command with Docker running. 

```shell
docker-compose up

A port for frontend and backend should appear. Try open port 3000 on local to see
